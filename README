In order to run follow the steps outlined below:

1. Download ActionBarSherlock version 3.5.1 from the following URL: http://actionbarsherlock.com/download.html
2. Create a new Android project folder in Eclipse from the unzipped source file e.g. ~/ActionBarSherlock-3.5.1/library
3. Make sure the project targets Android version 3.2, if you don't have it install using Android SDK Manager and don't forget to create an AVD for that build as well
4. Link your Cookbook project to the ActionBarSherlock library project in project properties
5. Make sure Cookbook project is also targetting Android version 3.2

Next Steps:

1. Read Action Bar design patterns to get some inspiration: http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html
2. Understand Fragments: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/fragments.html
3. Check out some samples of ActionBarSherlock apps: https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/tree/master/samples

N.B. Your class will now have to extend FragmentActivity and will need to include the import statement: "import android.support.v4.app.*;"
